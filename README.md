# Prayag_AI-4-fram-chashmaah1. Planning & Design
Requirements Gathering: I can help you draft a functional specification or a project scope document.

Architecture & Logic: We can map out the system flow, database schemas (like your synergyState JSON), or user experience (UX) maps.

Style Guides: I can generate CSS themes, color palettes, and typography choices (like choosing between Noto Sans Devanagari or Courier New for a HUD).

2. Development & Coding
Frontend Engineering: I can write or debug HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), and Bootstrap 5.

Interpreter Simulation: As we did with the Ezhil example, I can write logic to parse custom strings or localized languages.

API Integration: I can help you connect your frontend to a backend using fetch() or Axios to handle real-time data sync.

3. Content & Localization
Multilingual Support: I can provide translations or content in Tamil, Sanskrit, Hindi, and many other languages while ensuring proper UTF-8 rendering.

Technical Writing: I can generate README.md files, user manuals, or inline code documentation.
